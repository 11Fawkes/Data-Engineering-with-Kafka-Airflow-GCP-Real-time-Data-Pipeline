⚡ **Data Engineering with Kafka, Airflow & GCP – Real-time Data Pipeline**  

This project is a **real-time data pipeline** built using **Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to **ingest, transform, and process data efficiently**.  
It showcases how to handle **both batch and real-time streaming data** using **BigQuery for structured storage and analytics**.

---

## 🔹 **What This Project Covers**
✔ **Ingested Titanic dataset into Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** for structured storage.  
✔ **Loaded raw data into Google BigQuery** for analytics and processing.  
✔ **Automated ETL workflows with Apache Airflow** to manage data extraction, transformation, and loading.  
✔ **Simulated real-time data streaming using Apache Kafka**, publishing Titanic passenger events.  
✔ **Transformed and validated data using Python & Pandas**, ensuring clean, high-quality insights.  
✔ **Built interactive dashboards in Looker Studio** to visualize survival trends, demographics, and ticket pricing.

## 🔹 **How It Works (Step-by-Step)**  

1️⃣ Data Ingestion & Storage** 

2️⃣ Data Processing with Airflow**  

3️⃣ Real-Time Data Streaming with Kafka**  

4️⃣ Data Warehouse & Analytics**  

---

## 📊 **Insights & Visualizations**
✅ **Survival trends** by gender, class, and age (**e.g., women & first-class passengers had higher survival rates**).  
✅ **Demographic breakdown of passengers** (**e.g., majority were from third-class**).  
✅ **Ticket pricing vs. survival rate analysis** (**e.g., higher ticket prices correlated with better survival rates**).
